**Noodle jam, according to Pierre Dac**

Before using the noodle to make jam, you must
obviously harvest it; before harvesting it, it must grow, and to
that it grows, it goes without saying that it must first be sowed.
The sowing of the noodle seed, that is to say the senel, represents
an extremely delicate operation. First of all, the choice of suitable land
to the fertilization of the noodle requires a judiciously in-depth study. THE
typical coal-producing land must be, as much as possible, located at the edge of the
departmental road and close to the national gendarmerie.
Before sowing the noodle seed, noodle farmers prepare the noodle for a long time
noodle field to make it suitable for fertilization. They return the
land with a special plow whose share is replaced by a Gillette blade,
then abandoning chemical fertilizers, clearly contraindicated in the case
Now, they smoke the noodle field with grated cheese. This operation
is carried out either with a syringe or a bicycle pump.
When the field is sufficiently impregnated with grated cheese, pour over everything
its surface of mint alcohol in the proportion of a glass of Bordeaux per
hectare of area; this operation which is entrusted to specialists from
the School of Nouilliculture, is carried out with a dropper.
After that, the earth is left to ferment for the duration of the new
moon and as soon as the first quarter appears, we then proceed to the senouilles
noodle seed. You should not imagine, ladies and
Gentlemen, that noodle seed is a common trade and that it is
commonly found among seed growers; if you believe this, it is
indisputable that you are grazing the hills of error. The noodle seed does not
is obtained only after a very long laboratory preparation, because it is the
product of a cross of calf liver with adult cucumber; here is
moreover some details on this marvelous con]unction which is the
glory of our chemists, whose science is matched only by their modesty.
We put side by side, in a washing machine, a slice of calf's liver and a
adult cucumber, place everything in an autoclave and leave it there for 45 days
at a temperature of 120º under the guidance of a Company controller
some gas; at the end of this period of time, we open the device and all we have to do is
collect the precious seed that we will pour into the earth ready for
receive and which it will fertilize.
The senouilles are carried out using a mobile stove into which the
seed, which is projected into the earth by a special device which does not
we are not allowed to reveal the secret for reasons of national defense
which will be easily understood. After that, we water the entire field with
siphons of seltzer water, then dry with blotting paper, give a blow
feather duster and we just have to rely on the work of the nourishing earth
and to the immortal, generous and democratic nature. When the senouilles
are finished, the nouilliculturists who are still tainted by superstition,
consult the omens; they take a little mole, run it through
the grass and if it goes: "ooh!" the harvest will be good; if she doesn't
don't say "ooh!" it is that the harvest will be good all the same, but like that
beliefs are respected, and everyone is happy.
During germination, there is almost nothing to do; every eight days
only, we water the field with cade oil, cigar ash,
lemon juice and glycerin to prevent the earth from cracking.
During the harvest, the nights witness wholesome rejoicings in which
the nouilliculture workers engage, the youth dance and get away
gives delight to the sounds of an orchestra composed of a harmonium, a
mandolin and a cavalry trumpet; young people put on their
regional costume composed of a frock coat, cycling pants, espadrilles
and a Kronstadt hat; the young girls, blushing with modest joy,
are dressed in delightful poultice canvas dresses, decorated with yokes
in schputnoutz, and gird their foreheads with a crown of hard-boiled eggs of the most
graceful effect A fireworks display fired with Pigeon lamps closes the series
rejoicing and everyone returns home, happy with the work accomplished, to
then proceed to make the noodle jam, the subject of this
study. The noodle, still in its raw state, is then carefully sorted and freed of
its impurities; after an initial stage, it is sent to the factory and passed
immediately to the laminouille which will give it the definitive appearance that we
know – the laminouille is an extremely sophisticated machine, which
guignolet-cassis walk and which can produce up to 80 kilometers of noodles
on time - ; at the end of the laminouille, the noodle is varnished
cellulose which makes it waterproof and flexible; it is then chopped finely
the boarding ax and grated. Grating is still done by hand and with a
wood rasp. After grating, the noodle is then bottled, operation
very delicate which requires a lot of attention; we then put the bottles
in a device called electronouille, through which a current of 210 passes
volts; after a stay of 12 hours in this device, the bottles are
exits and we empty the now electrified noodle into a container placed
himself on a high voltage alcohol stove.
We then pour into said container: salt, sugar, cayenne pepper,
ginger, cinnamon, oil, crushed potato, flake
bismurated magnesia, rice, carrots, sausage skins, tomatoes,
white wine, and red peppers, we slowly mix these ingredients with
the noodle using a spoon and leave to simmer over low heat
for 21 days. The noodle jam is then virtually finished.
When the 21 days are up and the cooking has reached its point
culminating and definitive, the container is placed in a cupboard, so that the
jam solidifies and becomes gelatinous; when she is completely
cooled, we lift the container very delicately, with infinite
precautions and maximum caution and we throw everything out the window
because it’s not good!

**Unlike noodle jam, Rust is good, eat it!**

## Exercice 00 : ft_putchar

• Write a function that displays the character passed as a parameter.
• It must be prototyped as follows:

```rust
fn ft_putchar(c: char) {}
```

To display the character you need to use the write function in the way
next

```rust
use std::io::Write;

std::io::stdout().write_all(&[c as u8]).unwrap();
```

## Exercice 01 : ft_print_alphabet

• Write a function that displays the lowercase alphabet on a single line, in
ascending order, starting from the letter 'a'.

• It must be prototyped as follows:

```rust
fn ft_print_alphabet() {}
```
